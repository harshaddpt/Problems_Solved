## 🔧 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external dependencies required (using only built-in libraries)

### Running Solutions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshaddpt/Problems_Solved.git
   cd Problems_Solved
   ```

2. **Navigate to the platform directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Code_Forces
   ```

3. **Run individual solutions:**
   ```bash
   # For Theatre Square problem
   python "A. Theatre Square .py"
   
   # For Watermelon problem  
   python "A. Watermelon .py"
   
   # For Way Too Long Words problem
   python "A. Way Too Long Words .py"
   ```

4. **Input format:** Each solution expects input according to the problem specification
   - Theatre Square: `n m a` (space-separated integers)
   - Watermelon: `w` (single integer)
   - Way Too Long Words: First line contains `t` (number of test cases), followed by `t` words

### Example Usage
```bash
# Theatre Square example
echo "6 6 4" | python "A. Theatre Square .py"
# Output: 4

# Watermelon example  
echo "8" | python "A. Watermelon .py"
# Output: YES
```
